# TUM_Info_Grade
This is a grade calculator for the master of informatics at the Technical University of Munich.
**I do not assure, that this calculator resembles the grade calculated by th University! This is only my best guess.**
The script follows FPSO 2018.

You can replace the list of grades in the script with your own ones to estimate your final grade and
estimate the effect of certain modules.
